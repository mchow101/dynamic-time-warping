# dynamic-time-warping
Using k-means clustering of time series using dynamic time warping to find distances

This repository mainly consists of Python code to prepare the data, create time series of given data, and use k-means clustering with dynamic time warping to show trends in the data.

In addition there is Java code to demonstrate the algorithms used.
